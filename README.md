# Coffee-Shop-Sales

Hello Everyone this is my first Sales Analysis Project using MS Excel which helps in figuring out the Sales of the Coffee Shops Established in various parts of United States.

In this project I found answers to following questions :-

>> How do sales vary by day of the week and hour of the day ?
>> Are there any peak times for sales activity ?
>> What is the total sales revenue for each month ?
>> How do sales vary across different store locations ?
>> What is the average price/order per person ?
>> Which products are the bestselling in terms of quantity and revenue ?
>> How do sales vary by product category and type ?
